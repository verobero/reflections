When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository would be useful when we work in teams.
More than one person can work on a single project.
And all these results can be connected via github.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-might take up too much resources to update periodically
-there might be cases where we intentionally want them to be different to test out new things in the local before updating to remote.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: cloning from another repository on GitHub to GitHub
Clones: cloning from one repository to a local repository
Branches: creating another version of the currently active branch.
Forks are used to clone from GitHub to GitHub.
Clones are used to clone from one repository (local or remote) to local repository.
Branchs are used to create a version of the currently active branch, while still maintaining the main branch.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Storing the last known state of remote lets git know the status of the remote's last commit
when pulled to local.
That way, we can compare files from remote and local before merging
to see whether there are conflicts.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without using Git or GitHub:
Would probably share files with colleagues through a cloud service like Google Drive.
What's easier: Interface and user experience.
What's harder: Harder to manage and customize versions.
