When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository would be useful when we work in teams.
More than one person can work on a single project.
And all these results can be connected via github.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-might take up too much resources to update periodically
-there might be cases where we intentionally want them to be different to test out new things in the local before updating to remote.
